# So I’m a Square, So What? 🔲

A stylish, hand-drawn top-down shooter where you play as a square with a gun.  
Enemies spawn. You shoot them. They die.  
Simple, punchy, and weirdly satisfying.

This build focuses on **core combat only**:
- Player movement  
- Shooting system  
- Enemy AI + death  
- Basic arena prototype  

No waves or bosses yet — just pure square-on-square violence.
